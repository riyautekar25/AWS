# AWS Hands-On Mini Projects

## Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the Internet (“the cloud”). Instead of owning physical data centers or servers, companies and individuals can rent access to computing power and resources from a cloud provider. This enables scalable, cost-effective, and on-demand computing solutions.

## What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the leading cloud platforms, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. AWS helps individuals and organizations by providing cloud-based solutions to store data, run applications, and scale resources with ease. AWS provides a wide range of services such as EC2 for computing power, S3 for scalable storage, RDS for managed databases, and Lambda for serverless computing.

## Project Purpose

This repository is a collection of hands-on mini projects designed to help beginners like myself learn AWS. The objective of this project is to explore various AWS services through practical implementation and understand how they fit into real-world scenarios.

## Learning Goals

- Understand how cloud computing works through AWS.
- Gain hands-on experience with essential AWS services.
- Learn to deploy, manage, and monitor cloud-based applications.
- Explore how to create scalable and cost-effective cloud solutions.
- Familiarize yourself with security best practices in AWS.

## Future Plans

As I continue to explore AWS, I plan to add more complex projects and document the learning process. Feel free to fork this repository and contribute by opening pull requests or raising issues.
