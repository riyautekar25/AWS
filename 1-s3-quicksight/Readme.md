# Visualize Data using Amazon QuickSight | AWS Project

## Project Overview

Dashboards are a proven and effective way to visualize and analyze data. Amazon QuickSight is a powerful tool provided by AWS that allows users to create interactive dashboards from the data hosted in AWS services, such as S3. In this mini project, I learned how to build a QuickSight dashboard using data stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

I followed **Lucy Wang's** tutorial from her YouTube channel [@techwithlucy](https://www.youtube.com/@techwithlucy), which provided a clear and step-by-step guide on utilizing Amazon QuickSight. Her approach made the process simple and easy to follow.

This project is straightforward and designed to help beginners understand how to use Amazon QuickSight to visualize data from an S3 bucket.
